There are many ways to drive traffic to your website. There are many factors to consider but for starters. Here’s a list of things to do if you’re a content marketer and search savvy. This approach was design to be easy and using some of the top SEO tools such as Ahrefs, SemRush and Moz.

Ok, but I gotta warn you, you may not get everything that you want to know about each of these SEO tools. We’re only going to do some basic stuff but packs a lot of bang. Trying to go for the user friendly approach.

This approach is not for the Python users or Excel Ninja’s out there. Its for the content marketer (writers, digital strategist, anybody,etc..) that are on a time crunch that needs to be able to gather the data quickly and see an easy opportunity to move the needle.

Keywords Difficulty and Search Volume
One of the best method for seeing how much potential a topic is worth going after, is by filtering the keywords difficulty level and search volume. Each respective tools have this featured embedded, how accurate are the numbers this is beyond the scope of this article. Here have a look:

What is cool about Ahrefs is that their keyword tools also gives you an estimated clicks amount from the search result page. Their Keyword difficulty numbers represent the numbers of back links the specific article has pointing to it. Such as a KD of 10 is an estimated 10 links, KD 20 is 20 links, etc…

Moz Keyword Research

Moz has multiple ways to view the keyword lists and in order to get this particular view, you would need to create a list and append the topic keywords to it. Their “organic click-thru-rate” is the equivalent to Ahrefs clicks. The differences is that Moz gives the numbers in percentile. (The higher the better!)
Here is Moz’s definition of their keyword difficulty – Moz’s Difficulty score takes into account the Page Authority (PA) and Domain Authority (DA) scores of the results ranking on the first page of Google’s search engine for the given query. It also intelligently modifies for projected click-through-rate (CTR) of a given page (putting more weight on high-ranking, more visible pages and less on low-ranking, less visible pages). The algorithm also accounts for newer pages on powerful domains that may have DA scores but not yet assigned PA values.

SemRush

SemRush is considered one of the leading keyword research tools. Yes, for other things like competitive research and filtering by search intent, it is a beast to be reckon with. Unfortunately, for this particular simple task theres not much to show but the simple filtering of keyword difficulty level which SemRush normalizes their numbers by the percentile.
Here is SemRush KD numbers (percentile) broken down:

There are 3 difficulty levels:

Above 80%: High Difficulty
In order to rank for a keyword with difficulty over 80%, you would need to invest in SEO and link building practices. If you are working with a brand new site, these keyword targets most likely would not be worth your time.

From 60%-80%: Medium Difficulty
Getting on the first page for keywords in this range won’t be easy, but it is more realistic to target a keyword in this range compared to a keyword over 80%, especially if your website has some authority in your market.

Below 60%: Low Difficulty
These keywords are the easiest to rank for but the hardest to find. Keywords with difficulty below 60% that also have steady search volume represent your best opportunities for ranking your pages with SEO.

Opportunity Scores
A quick word on “opportunity scores”, all 3 SEO tools have this. This information is to be considered when going after those possible rankings. Each respective tools have certain nuances but overall it is based on The authority score of the domain applied to the page authority level. The more authoritative domain (bigger (established)brand) can absolutely get the page to rank quickly. At the page level, if you have more links pointing to the page the better.

Another good thing to know is that Ahrefs a while back conducted a correlation study and plotted page-level backlink factors next to domain-level backlink factors. The results: Page-level factors correlate much more strongly than domain-level factors.

Quora Questions
Did you know that Quora is like another search engine, but with questions as the query. So the idea is to ask Quora about a subject and see what the results are. Then, plug in your answer to it, in other words you would go to the question thread and provide an answer. Quora being a heavy weight site, there is a chance that the question/answer may be ranked for decent search volume in the SERP.
Any of the 3 SEO tools can find your question that pertains to your industry. (maybe) Semrush site explorer does a great job of giving us data of a domain. Once you get the results, its now just a matter of filtering the phrases thats applicable to your content. Yes, this explanation is simple, because it is, here’s a visual breakdown of this method.

So using SemRush, you would plugin Quora domain and run it. Then go down to the keyword section. Once the data populates you can filter with just about any subject/topic. In this example, I had inserted “pocket pistol”, you will see the result. The three highlighted boxes to consider are: Volume, KD (keyword difficulty) and URL of the thread question. Since the domain is on Quora there shouldn’t be much problem for it to rank in the search. So the volume may be more of a priority in your decision making to consider. The URL provides you the page in Quora for you to go and give an answer.

What happens now is that when Google/Bing/GoDucks re-indexes Quora, your comments are now visible. Some users possibly may visit your website if you had a compelling message/comment.

Parasite
This tactic is similar to using Quora but instead you’re using other highly chatty traffic sites similar to forums/Reddit based to talk about the subject. What you find all depends on the subject/topic of respective industry. The idea is that you’re piggybacking on an established site that gets huge organic traffic and you’re getting in front of those eyeballs.
For example, say you’re a frontend web developer and you want to share a cool way of applying a responsive design without having to code it with media queries in CSS. Sorry for the little tech-ish talk. Here have a look at the pic below.

So yeh, basically what I’m talking about is that if you were looking at a web page on a desktop on your PC or Mac. The display shows all the boxes with rows and columns. But when you look at the page on a mobile device like your phone. Everything is stacked on top of each other. Which is what we mean by responsive.

Ok, lets get back to the meat of this – to share this awesome code you would want to go on a site call “CodePen”.
<img src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/packs/editor-embed-eae2ee445ef0f63ee8fc7f175858e9d9.png">

This site allows you to put codes up and you can see the result of the codes all on the same screen. Not only is this an amazing site for web developers but many many devs hang out here to share or work on their apps. The idea is to implement your content(codes) and crossing your fingers other devs will mingle with you.

Another approach, say if you didn’t have any cool codes to share but just admire other devs work. You can still interact with them about that xyz project. As time goes by you can talk about your stuff.

Youtube/Rumble and Social Media Platform
This alternative can be combine with your articles that you write up and embed your videos into it. But for those that hate to write or just not an AP level wordsmither. But, you love shooting videos and think that you’re the next Spielberg. Use your camera and load it up onto Youtube, Rumble is an alternative video site and yes there are others. (Vimeo, )
I’m hinting towards Youtube because it does belong to Google and is considered a search engine as well for videos. When you edit your video on Youtube, lets hope that you had applied some keyword research that I had described above. And, implement those keywords/topics sprinklings into your title and descriptions.
Just a quick word if your Youtube account/channel is fairly new. Chances are your content will not rank right away in the SERP.
But, don’t despair you just have to manually syndicate your video to other social platform to ignite your presences.

Closing thoughts There you have it – this is not the complete list of finding ways to drive traffic to your website. But, I hope it will ignite your brain to think further to what you can do in your industry. Some of these SEO/Digi Marketing techniques can be applied to most industries. Last is just words from the trench – moving the needle takes work, lots of work – just have a plan of action and follow it.
